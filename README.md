### Welcome to my libft repository 👋

⭐️ The goal of this subject is to recode few functions of the C standard library
⭐️ First project of 42cursus, not perfect, be indulgent :)

## 💡 Usage
- make => it will create the library libft.a that you can include in your projects to call my functions
- make bonus => include functions related to linked lists (some functions may be wrong)
